# ZAP-Blogging-Framework

 This is a blogging framework created in Flask. It uses REST API for content management allowing for third-party apps to create articles and users. This framework offers the basic features for it to follow its base architecture. The current version of this framework is a work-in-progress it's not even production ready yet. This is framework isn't recommended for beginners. But this is a full-fledge project intended to be used as a template rather than to serve as a module like any other Flask-related packages. This is similar to a package named 'Flask-blogging'.
